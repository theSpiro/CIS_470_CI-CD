# CIS_470_CI-CD
A simple CI/CD project for CIS_470


This is a javascript calculator that is very simple in functionality. The main part of this project is to see the CI/CD pipeline. 
This happens whenver a push happens in the GitHub repo on the main branch. When this happens we run all of our test cases as written in compute.test.js.
Once these test cases past we then deploy to Lambda which can be see in the YAML file in workflows.
